Executable that converts written numbers in words to digits in the middle of a paragraph



Write an executable that converts written numbers in words to digits in the middle of a
paragraph
  ○ Examples
    ■ If the input is ‘one hundred and one’, the output should be ‘101’
    ■ If the input is ‘I have one hundred apples’ the output should be ‘I have 100 apples’
  ○ Try to take into account corner cases
  ○ The application should be tested as well. Code coverage is important.
  ○ Numbers can only be positive integers up to one billion (10^9)
Application architecture design is up to you, verboseness about it is good.
The code has to be at least C++14 compliant.
If possible the build system should be CMake.
The project should be uploaded to GitHub/Bitbucket.
It should work on linux and windows
The submitted code should be production ready
